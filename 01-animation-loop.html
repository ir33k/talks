   * 1. window.requestAnimationFrame should be used to perform
   *    animation operations instead of setInterval or setTimeout.
   *    It's because callback function passed as an argument to
   *    window.requestAnimationFrame will be evaluated right before
   *    browser repaints window.  This ensure better performance.
   *
   * 2. Callback function will receive timestamp as first argument
   *    with value in milliseconds that tells us how much time pass
   *    since first call of window.requestAnimationFrame.
   *
   *
   * TODO Show timestamp in seconds.
   * TODO Show how to stop animation at any time.
