   The most basic shapes that can be drawn are: rectangle, circle, ellipse,
   line, polyline (line with many points) and polygon (closed shape with
   many points).  All of them are easy to write by hand and useful for
   simple icons, masking, animations etc.

   In SVG element reference documentation you can find detail information on
   all of those shapes.  Note that list of SVG elements contains many other
   elements that are not shapes.

      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element

   There is also <path> element that can draw any shape with straight and
   curved lines.  Its used the most when SVG is generated from graphical
   software.  It's not that easy to write it manually but we will go back to
   it later because it's the most useful of all.

   Different shapes can use different attributes but in all of them you can
   always look for attributes that:

   a) define position of object
   b) define shepe of object
   c) define look (color, border, etc.) of object
   d) define modifications (animations, masks, etc.) of object

   The more attributes you know the more simple solutions you will be able
   to apply.  I encourage to look through list of all attributes just to
   have in mind whats possible.  Below are few most common examples on
   simple shapes.

<svg width="512" height="420" viewBox="0 0 512 420" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

  <!-- Rectangle with x,y position of top left corner set to 10,20.  Size
       set to 60x80 px, filled with green color and black stroke with
       thickness of 2px. -->

  <rect x="10" y="20" width="60" height="80" fill="green" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" />

  <!-- This rectangle is a square with the same width and height.  There is
       no fill color (so its transparent) and thick 5px stroke uses red
       color defined with hex value.  Also it defines rounded corners with
       "rx" and "ry".  One with px second with percent unit. -->

  <rect x="80" y="10" rx="10" ry="5%" width="70" height="70" fill="none" stroke="#ff0000" stroke-width="5" />

  <!-- Here we have another square that don't define any fill and stroke
       colors.  It will have black fill by default and no stroke.  Also only
       single rounded corner value is defined with "rx" attribute.  This
       gives all corners the same value of 10 px in this example. -->

  <rect x="95" y="30" rx="10" width="40" height="40" />

  <!-- This rectangle has slightly transparent stroke and more transparent
       fill defined with longer hex value where #RRGGBBAA RR is red, GG is
       green, BB is blue and AA is alpha value.  First rectangle with no
       stroke is just for background so transparency is more visible.

       Note that with thick transparent stroke you can clearly see that
       stroke is drawn in the middle of the rectangle edge dividing stroke
       to outside ind inside parts.  There was a proposal to control if
       stroke should be drawn inside or outside or in the middle but for
       now it can NOT be controlled. -->

  <rect x="180" y="30" width="60" height="60" fill="red" />
  <rect x="170" y="10" width="60" height="60" fill="#00000050" stroke="#0000ff88" stroke-width="10" />

  <!-- "stroke-linejoin" control how corners of stroke should look like.
       First type is the default. -->

  <rect x="260" y="20" width="60" height="60" fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="20" stroke-linejoin="miter"/>
  <rect x="350" y="20" width="60" height="60" fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="20" stroke-linejoin="round"/>
  <rect x="440" y="20" width="60" height="60" fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="20" stroke-linejoin="bevel"/>

  <!-- Simple circle with "cx" and "cy" defining center of the circle and
       "r" setting radius to 80 px.  In this example we use styles for
       setting fill and stroke value.  Value of "id" attribute is used as
       selector but we can select SVG elements any way we want.  Note that
       we can even change values of position and size on :hover. -->

  <circle id="circleWithStyle" cx="90" cy="190" r="80" />
  <style>
    #circleWithStyle { fill: red; stroke: black; transition: all .5s }
    #circleWithStyle:hover { fill: #ff000044; stroke-width: 8px; r: 60px; cy: 170px }
  </style>

  <!-- Ellipse is essentially the same as circle but radius value is divided
       into two values "rx" and "ry", this is radius in x and y axis. -->
  
  <ellipse cx="250" cy="140" rx="80" ry="30" fill="none" stroke="black" />

  <!-- Line is defined by 2 x,y points.  This example also demonstrate
       "stroke-linecap".  First value is default, second makes round stroke
       at each point and last give points square look (in this example it
       looks like line is longer because of that). -->

  <line x1="350" x2="380" y1="110" y2="200" stroke="black" stroke-width="20" stroke-linecap="butt"/>
  <line x1="400" x2="430" y1="110" y2="200" stroke="black" stroke-width="20" stroke-linecap="round"/>
  <line x1="450" x2="480" y1="110" y2="200" stroke="black" stroke-width="20" stroke-linecap="square"/>

  <!-- Polyline is essentially a line with many points.  Points are defined
       in "x y" pairs separated by spaces in "pints" attribute.  You can
       also notice "stroke-opacity" attribute and another example with
       "stroke-linejoin" already demonstrated on rectangles. -->

  <polyline points="200 200 250 300 300 200 350 300 400 200 450 300"
            fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="16" stroke-opacity="1" stroke-linejoin="miter" />
  <polyline points="200 250 250 350 300 250 350 350 400 250 450 350"
            fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="16" stroke-opacity="50%" stroke-linejoin="round" />
  <polyline points="200 300 250 400 300 300 350 400 400 300 450 400"
            fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="16" stroke-opacity="0.7" stroke-linejoin="bevel" />

  <!-- Polygon is the same thing as polyline but it will join first
       and last point with line making closed shape -->

  <polygon points="20 300 25 400 100 400 200 350 180 320" />

</svg>

     discover on your own -->
